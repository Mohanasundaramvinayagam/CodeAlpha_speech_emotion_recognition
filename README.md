# Speech Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship program.

## Project Title
Speech Emotion Recognition

## Description
This project focuses on detecting human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, and Calm from audio speech using machine learning. It involves extracting relevant audio features and using a trained neural network to classify the emotion expressed in speech.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for model building)
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Features
- Detects emotion from audio samples
- Uses MFCC feature extraction
- Trained on the RAVDESS dataset
- Integrated with a simple Flask web interface for real-time predictions
